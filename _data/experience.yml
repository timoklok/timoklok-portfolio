    The VPRO is the most foreward thinking public broadcaster of The Netherlands, and I am very proud to be part of the Innovation and Digital Media team. As a frontender I get to develop and maintain various platforms such as VPRO.nl and 3voor12. Besides, we do occasional one-off projects such as 14-18, Door het Hart van China, or Onzichtbaar Nederland.

    At Restruct we conceptualized, designed and developed online solutions, all from a personal approach. As a small company of three designers/programmers, we specialized in user-friendly projects and processes. Within Restruct, I focussed mainly on frontend-development but also contributed with (UX-)design, concept-development and customer-relations.

    As a jack-of-all-trades I supported the Media Design department in various ways. I was a tutor first and foremost, supporting students in their projects, both technically and conceptually. Besides tutoring, I was repsonsible for the design and development of promotion-material, setting up expositions various supporting tasks such as managing the student archive and recording live events.
